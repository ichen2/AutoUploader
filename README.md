The aim of this project is to create a program which will automatically upload zoom video files to Box.com.

## Background
I currently work as a tutor for my university, tutoring several subjects including calculus, Java, and 
general algorithms and data structures. Due to the pandemic, all the tutoring is conducted via Zoom. 
My university requires tutors to upload video recordings of our tutoring sessions to Box.com. We must 
manually find and rename the video files, and then upload them to Box.com. This leads to extra work for 
tutors, people forgetting to upload their files, and typos in file names. To prevent this and help 
my coworkers and I, I decided to write a program to automate this process.
